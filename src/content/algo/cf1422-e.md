Maybe I'll make it a habit of only posting editorial blogs for problems which have atcoderish statements

### Problem [CF-1422E](https://codeforces.com/contest/1442/problem/E)

### Statement

> You are given a tree with each vertex coloured white, black or grey. You can remove vertices from the tree by selecting a subset of vertices in a single connected component and removing them and their adjacent edges from the graph. The only restriction is that you are not allowed to select a subset containing a white and a black vertex at once.
> 
> What is the minimum number of removals necessary to remove all vertices from the tree?

### Solution
