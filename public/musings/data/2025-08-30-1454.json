{"v":1,"id":"2025-08-30-1454","ts":"2025-08-30T09:24:00Z","tier":"public","md":"Every class in [my cp library](https://github.com/welcome-to-the-sunny-side/libra) follows the naming convention `<name of the data structure or algorithm it implements>_chan`\n\nA natural progression of this moe-ification of my beloved code waifus is to associate each of them with cute, distinctive visual forms, but I'm having trouble deciding what these forms should be.\n\nOn the one hand, I could just use regular images, but I cannot have these greet my vision whenever I use my library (save through an ugly intermediate step of having a link in my code). On the other hand, I could have ASCII art of them directly embedded within my code, but that has its own issues (bounding the width, a loss of quality, etc.).\n\nAs I type this, a rather promising idea has made itself accessible to my mind. What if, instead of putting my waifu into my code... *I put my code into my waifu*?! For a certain target image and some given code, I can simply append characters to my code until it's sufficiently long and then arbitrarily format my code until it fuzzily approximates the image (I say fuzzily because circumventing the atomicity of keywords/variable names via `#define`s is something I do not have the time to do).\n\nI would obviously not work with these formatted implementations directly, but rather with human-readable source code that is automatically made presentable through a waifufication layer before reaching the location of its outward-facing use. I suppose I'll also have to add links to the source code so that this isn't considered obfuscation (although even Mike would likely be swayed by the sheer kawaiiiii and make an exception)."}
