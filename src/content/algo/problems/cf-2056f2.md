This is the harder version of the problem I previously discussed [here](https://www.welcome-to-the-sunny-side.com/algo/problems/cf-2056f1.html).

### Problem [CF-2056F2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2056/F2)

### Statement

> A sequence $a$ of $n$ integers is called **good** iff the following condition holds:
> 
> - Let $cnt_x$ be the number of occurrences of $x$ in the sequence $a$.
> - For all pairs $0 \leq i < j < m$, at least one of the following must be true:
>   - $cnt_i = 0$
>   - $cnt_j = 0$
>   - $cnt_i \leq cnt_j$
> 
> In other words, if both $i$ and $j$ are present in the sequence, then the number of occurrences of $i$ must be **less than or equal to** the number of occurrences of $j$.
> 
> You are given integers $n$ and $m$. Compute the **bitwise XOR of the medians** of all **good** sequences $a$ of length $n$, where each element $a_i$ satisfies $0 \leq a_i < m$.

Constraints:

- $n \leq 2^{10^5}$ (given to us in its binary form)
- $m \leq 10^9$

### Solution

I'm going to pick up right where I left off in the previous blog.

Notice the changes in this version - the constraints on $k$ and $m$ have both increased by orders of magnitude, rendering our previous methods of approach (particularly those that required superlinear time w.r.t. $m$) useless.

Let's examine the algorithm we used earlier at a high level, and see if there are components vulnerable to optimization:

```
ans = 0
for median q from 0 to m - 1:
    par = 0
    for (# of unique elements) x from 1 to min(q + 1, k):
        if (C(q, x - 1) * f(k, x)) % 2 == 1
            par ^= 1
    if par == 1
        ans ^= q
```

Firstly, we cannot compute required values of $f$ trivially in $O(k^2)$ like we did earlier, but we can analyse the recurrence and realize that $f(i,j) = 1 \iff (i - j) \text{AND} ((j - 1)/2) = 0$ (where $\text{AND}$ is the bitwise-AND operation). The proof for this is left as an exercise to the reader. We can therefore get rid of the $O(k^2)$ precomputation we were performing earlier, and look up values for $f(i, j)$ in $O(1)$.

Now, as we already know from the ideas introduced in the previous blog: $(\binom{q}{x - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}) \iff ((x - 1) \text{ is a submask of } q)$, so when iterating over the number of unique elements $x$, we can simply ignore all $x$ where $x - 1$ isn't a submask of $q$. To make things more convenient, let's redefine $x$ to be the number of unique elements besides the median (just so we can say "$x$ must be a submask of $q$" instead of "$x - 1$ must be a submask of $q$"). The algorithm now becomes:

```
ans = 0
for median q from 0 to m - 1:
    par = 0
    for submask x of q such that x < k:
        par ^= f(k, x + 1)
    if par == 1
        ans ^= q
```

It should not be difficult to spot some glaring redundancy here, namely the fact that $\text{par}$ can be computed in an identical manner for several $q$!

Why is this the case? Notice that while $q$ can be rather large, we limit the submasks $x$ to the range $[0, k)$, where $k$ is at most $10^5$. This means that only the first $L = \lceil \log_2{k} \rceil$ bits of $q$ determine whether $x$ is a submask of $q$ or not. 

To avoid this redundancy, we can instead compute the value of $\text{par}$ only once for every suffix mask (least significant bits) of $L$ bits (which is feasible since $2^L \approx O(k)$), and if it turns out to be $1$, we know that we would have individually XOR'd the answer with $q$ for all $q$ which have this mask as a suffix in our original algorithm, so we can now just try to process all of those individual changes together! Note that we can also conveniently ignore the restriction that $x < k$, and instead just let it be a submask of $2 ^ L$ as $f(k, x) = 0$ for $x > k$ in any case.

Our algorithm now reduces to the following:

```
ans = 0
for (median suffix mask) p from 0 to (2^L - 1):
    par = 0
    for submask x of p:
        par ^= f(k, x + 1)
    if par == 1
        ans ^= (q : (the first L bits of q = p))
```

Now, the problem decomposes to two easy and independent subproblems:

1. Finding $(\bigoplus_{x \subseteq p} f(k, x + 1)) \forall p \in [0, 2^L)$ (here $x \subseteq p$ means that $x$ is a submask of $p$). This is a standard application of SOS DP, and warrants no further explanation from me.
2. Finding  $(\bigoplus_{p \subseteq_L q} q) \forall p \in [0, 2^L)$. This can be done in $O(1)$ but I hate digit analysis far too much to not have mindlessly bashed it in $O(\log_2^3{m})$.

So our final solution runs in $O(k \cdot (\log_2{k} + \log_2^3{m}))$ and can be optimized to $O(k \cdot \log_2{k})$ at the risk of one's sanity.

Code:

```cpp

        int k, m;
        cin >> k >> m;

        string n;
        cin >> n;

        k = count(n.begin(), n.end(), '1');

        int L = 0;
        while((1 << (L)) <= k)
            ++ L;

        auto f = [&](int a, int b) -> int
        {
            if(a < b)
                return 0;
            return ((a - b) & ((b - 1) >> 1)) == 0;
        };

        vector<int> sos(1 << L);
        for(int p = 0; p < (1 << L); p ++)
            sos[p] = f(k, p + 1);
        for(int i = 0; i < L; i ++)
            for(int p = 0; p < (1 << L); p ++)
                if((1 << i) & p)
                    sos[p] ^= sos[p ^ (1 << i)];

        int ans = 0;
        for(int p = 0; p < (1 << L); p ++)
        {

                                int sum = (1 << b) + p;
                                for(int i = 0; i < bits.size(); i ++)
                                    if((1 << i) & mid)
                                        sum += (1 << bits[i]);
