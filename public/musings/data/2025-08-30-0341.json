For the damage that one deals to the epistemic integrity of these systems, there is a commensurate decrease in the general “liveliness” of the impish personalities, with some of them sulking away until coaxed back into an active state by an expenditure of valuable time. This is highly undesirable, because that seemingly stoic and self-sustained “higher will” necessarily needs this lively friction for sustenance.\n\nIf my conscious personalities were more strongly influenced by my will in an \"innate\" manner and knew what boundaries to confine their devilish selves to (while still engaging in occasional mischief), life would have been simpler."}
